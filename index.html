            <p>major powers needs to be involve like in a direct war, not through some kind of expeditionary forces or coalition, this needs forming alliances and things to sustain such world war or else you'll end up like iraq, other oppositions are not dumbs, they would absolutely avoid war at all cost, and if they manage to find out early about this plan of yours, they will wait for u to strike and then a coalition would form just like what they did in iraq, unless if you have nuclear weapons then maybe you can piss off the whole wolrd but that's not enough, you're not gonna be able destroy, you lack nuclear weapons to do so, self destruction awaits your country, it's highly unlikely that it can bring the whole world to a thermo nuclear world war, do you really think anyone has the guts to bring desolation upon this world, a land worthless of occupation??. What's better is to divide all major powers and let them create alliances of their own and turn them against each other, don't involve nuclear weapons, prohibits them using excessive force. Like NATO ukraine situation or ASEAN south china sea claims. Those areas are places where world war is highly likely to happen, middle east is a war only to itself, but not for the world, all major powers need to involve directly and confrontational.</p>
